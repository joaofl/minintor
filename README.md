# minintor
Supervisor and monitor for the Claymore cryptocurrencie miner writen in Python3

For now, only works for single AMD GPUs (tested on a AMD RX580), running on Ubuntu 16.04.3


TODO List:

- Integrate GPU fan control
- Integrate GPU memory clock and voltage control as well for the cores
- Integrate UI/WebUI
